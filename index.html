		<h2>Steven's Youth Carrer</h2>
	    <p>My name is Steven S. Suah, I am 24 years old. I was born on a warm, sunny day in August in Nimba, County-Liberia.  I am currently attending the Weifang University of Science and Technology in China.
	    </p>
	    <p>I am the first born of my parents. I have a younger sister. She is eleven years.
           I started school when I was six years old in Guinea.
			I became trilingual, speaking fluent French and English as well, I made new friends from a lot of different cultural backgrounds.
			Then I moved back to Liberia, this time in capital Monrovia at the age of eleven years, where my dad got work. And I continued my school.
		</p>
        <h2>Steven's Education Background</h2>
		<p>I went to kindergarten through six grade at the Salvation and Deliverance Christian Academy Elementary school and while I was there, I won an award for perfect attendance. I also won a couple of awards for honor roll all four terms. Then I attended the Salvation and Deliverance Christian Academy junior high school, and there I also won couple of awards: one for perfect attendance and two for being named student of the Year one in eight grade and other in ninth grade. And I was promoted to the senior high and finally graduated with lots of honors in 2013.
		</p>
		<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
		<p>My hobbies are shopping, travelling, dancing and reading. I really love dacing because dacing brings me more joy and improve my outfit. 
           Dancing is my hobby. These days many people irrespective of their age do dancing. While dancing all you need are comfortable shoes and clothes.The reason behind my dancing is my parents. They are a great source of inspiration for me. They dance with me so that I can dance and take my hobby forward. I never dance in the same style but I like to mix up everything. I know many types of dancing such as Jaz, tap, modern, hip hop, swing and western .Dancing will always remain a part of my life. It is a kind of sports that every generation enjoys. On every special occasion I feel like dancing. <a href="afrodance.html">100% Afro Dance Group</a> When I dance in the parties nobody can stop me from moving my feet fast in the rhythm of the music. Even if someone does that it’s like applying efforts to stop a natural-disaster. Since childhood dancing is & has been my passion always. Dancing allows me to express my emotions. No matter where I am if music strikes my ears I feel like dancing.
<p>Dance is more than just a sport, it’s a passion. Dance is something you work hard for, something you put all of your spare time and effort into. Dance is a sport that you never want to give up on. When the day of your dance competition arrives, you put everything you have learned about dancing over the years, and show it all to the hundreds of people watching you. No matter how exhausted you are on that dance floor, you may not give up. You need to dance until the very end, until you are the best dancer you can possibly be. In order to be the best dance you can be, you need to practice during your spare time at home. The only way to get first in a dance competition is to practice all the time, make sure your dance costume looks exactly like the rest of your teams, and perform like you’ve never performed before.Besides that, I love travelling very much, because when I go to another places, I’ll get new friends. And also get unforgettable story for myself.And I love dancing and reading so much.</p>

        <h2>My Dream</h2>
        <P>
          I am the one who has big dream. Always trying to reach big achievement and to motivate the young's generation. But my laziness always tries to destroy my spirit. One of my weakness is I am not a person who has confident. I am shy when I want to talk in front of public. So, I decided to show my aspiration through the words.
		Besides weakness, I have an excess. I am an optimist boy, when I was a child, my parent always say that I am a success and I will be a successful man. I am sure that, I am smart, friendly, besides that I am a creative boy. I always do something that I want and I try to make something different that the other doesn’t mind it yet. I always try to give the best especially for myself and for other personple. I hope everything that I want to will be achieved.

	<h2>Why Motivation?</h2>
        <P>
          Motivational quotes can help you reach your potential each day. Sure, they’re just words. But they’re positive words. And if you’re on the verge of giving up or struggling to push yourself to the next level, sometimes that’s just what you need. So whether you’re trying to finish a project, start a new side hustle, or hit that big life goal, knowing how to motivate yourself can help. So, let’s dive into what is motivation, how to motivate yourself, and the motivational quotes of the day that’ll get you back on track. These motivational quotes will give you the jumpstart your day needs, so don’t forget to bookmark this page.

	<h2>What Is Motivation?</h2>
        <P>
          Motivation is your desire to do something with your personal life, at work, in school, in sports, or in any hobbies. Having the motivation to do something can help you achieve your big goals and dreams, whatever they may be.

Knowing how to motivate yourself can help you accomplish anything you set your mind to, so let’s get to that next.
	</P>
	<h1>Three Ways To Motivate Yourself:</h1>
        <P>
           <h2>1. Create a Positive Environment</h2>
          Music can be as powerful a motivator as motivational quotes. Each morning when you wake up, play a few pump up songs before you start your day to get you going. You can listen to playlists with motivational songs on Spotify to help you get going. By getting your mind in the right mindset, you can inch closer to motivating yourself. When I want to get in the zone, I listen to “Time” by Hans Zimmer, which has no lyrics but has an intensity which helps me focus. If I’m feeling like I’m in a rut, motivational songs like “You’re a Superstar” by Love Inc. picks me up.
	</P>
	
        <P>
        	<h2>2. Celebrate Your Small Wins</h2>
          When you think of your BIG goal, sometimes you start feeling overwhelmed. Why? Because big goals don’t get achieved right away. Instead, you need to create mini goals to help excite you along the way. This way you can be more goal-orientated and build a habit of being more effective. Celebrating your small wins will help you stay motivated through your journey. Plus, celebrating is always super fun. Maybe you break your goal down to 10 small-sized goals with tasks that get you on track to achieve them. For each of the 10 goals you can add a small celebration. Maybe a glass of champagne for one or a dessert with a sparkler on top for another. Don’t forget to check out some of our motivational quotes about success in a later section.

        	<h2>3. Surround Yourself With Motivated People</h2>
          This goes back to the positive environment point: You need to be around with others who are just ambitious as you. American entrepreneur John Rohn once said, “You’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with it.” And whether or not that’s true is debatable, the reality is being around the right kind of people can only help you grow. If you’re surrounded by those who love your ambition, you’ll be more ambitious and achieve more. If you’re surrounded by loved ones who tell you your goals are stupid and tell you to change them, you need to avoid them. Be around those who help you feel comfortable being the ambitious, go-getter you are, so you can become the successful person you’re meant to be.
